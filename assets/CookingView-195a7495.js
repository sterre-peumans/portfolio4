To accomplish this task, we employed a series of illustrative images to vividly represent each step in the cooking process. This challenge required us to explore the intersection of culinary guidance and visual communication, where we aimed not only to provide clear instructions but also to infuse them with a touch of visual appeal. </div><div class="pt-10 dark:text-white"> In my pursuit of improving my skills in instructional design, I started by looking at examples where drawings of hands were used in instructional materials. This was essential because I intended to incorporate such drawings in my own work. After this initial research, I closely studied the given recipe. </div><div class="pt-5 dark:text-white"> I then cooked it with a friend at my place, taking photos of each step along the way. I tried to organize these photos to create a visual sequence. At the same time, I began sketching out a rough outline of the steps in a storyboard. Moving forward, I created a prototype by sketching how I wanted my instructional content to look. I also started making some digital drawings to add to the mix. </div><div class="pt-5 dark:text-white"> Throughout the project, I experimented with different versions, particularly when it came to using various colors, to make sure the instructional content was engaging and effective. This process helped me improve my instructional design skills and get closer to creating an engaging educational tool. </div></div>',1),h={class:"grid grid-cols-3 gap-2 pt-10"},m=["src"],p=["src"],g=["src"],_={__name:"CookingView",setup(w){return(f,v)=>(n(),r(c,null,[u,t("div",h,[t("div",null,[t("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:e(a),alt:""},null,8,m)]),t("div",null,[t("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:e(o),alt:""},null,8,p)]),t("div",null,[t("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:e(s),alt:""},null,8,g)])]),l(i)],64))}};export{_ as default};
