These photographs served as the starting point for a series of color palettes that we were required to manually mix with paint. The emphasis here was on the interplay of color proportions and how they influence the viewer&#39;s perception. After mixing the color palettes, the objective was to portray these palettes on a medium, ensuring that the relationships between the colors were clearly visible. </div><div class="pt-10 dark:text-white"> The initiation of this project involved a deep dive into the realm of color contrasts and theory. My primary focus was directed towards the exploration of quantity contrast, which delves into the harmonious or discordant interplay of colors used in varying quantities alongside one another. This phase was pivotal in enhancing my understanding of how color relationships work. </div><div class="pt-5 dark:text-white"> To capture the essence of color in my daily life, I embarked on a picturesque journey through the vibrant streets of Leuven. This visual exploration was intended to encapsulate the hues I routinely encountered during my bike commute to school. My camera lens bore witness to a multitude of colors that adorned my surroundings. Thereafter, I utilized primary colors to mix and generate a multitude of swatches inspired by the photographed hues. To ascertain the most effective medium for my project, I embarked on a series of tests and experiments. Ten distinct approaches were explored, culminating in the decision to embrace the concept of a book. This forthcoming endeavor entails crafting narratives with the assistance of ChatGPT, presenting these stories as if they were extracted from the pages of a book, upon which I will overlay my carefully curated color blocks. These texts will seamlessly intertwine with the visual compositions and evoke a harmonious symphony of colors and emotions. </div><div class="pt-5 dark:text-white"> The result of these endeavors has yielded over 80 pages of stories, each breathing life into the colors and memories that have been captured and translated into a unique artistic tapestry. This project has not only deepened my appreciation for color but has also provided me with a platform to convey the profound emotional language embedded within this vivid spectrum. </div></div>',1),p={class:"grid grid-cols-3 gap-2 pt-10"},m=["src"],u=["src"],f=["src"],k={__name:"EyesView",setup(w){return(v,y)=>(r(),n(h,null,[d,e("div",p,[e("div",null,[e("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:t(s),alt:""},null,8,m)]),e("div",null,[e("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:t(a),alt:""},null,8,u)]),e("div",null,[e("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:t(i),alt:""},null,8,f)])]),l(o)],64))}};export{k as default};
