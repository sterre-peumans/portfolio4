This challenge prompted us to harness the capabilities of the LUCA Lab&#39;s laser cutters, 3D printers, and thermoformers. Working alongside my team, our attention was directed towards data related to solar energy generation, sunlight exposure, and a country&#39;s GDP. </div><div class="pt-10 dark:text-white"> Our project commenced with the collection and organization of data within a Google Spreadsheet, ensuring a clear and comprehensive arrangement. Subsequently, we engaged in a dynamic brainstorming phase, employing sketches to ascertain the most effective approach to visually representing our dataset. This critical phase encouraged a deep exploration of creative solutions, leading to the formation of a robust concept. </div><div class="pt-5 dark:text-white"> The culmination of our efforts resulted in a tangible creation, a two-part assembly featuring MDF and plexiglass elements. The MDF panel intricately portrayed a world map with varying elevations to denote the solar energy generated by each country. Its plexiglass counterpart also showcased a world map, with the transparency of engravings artfully conveying the degree of sunlight exposure for each nation. Furthermore, we employed a projector to project GDP data per country onto the plexiglass surface, offering a holistic perspective on the factors at play in each region. </div><div class="pt-5 dark:text-white"> This project not only expanded our knowledge of data visualization but also broadened our technical skill set. We learned to work with lasercutting technology and explore diverse materials, enhancing our capabilities in the realm of creative expression. These experiences underlined the symbiotic relationship between technical proficiency and creative ingenuity, reinforcing our dedication to the pursuit of innovative solutions. </div>',6),d={class:"pt-10"},p=["src"],w={__name:"SolarView",setup(h){return(u,g)=>(o(),i("div",l,[c,e("div",d,[e("img",{class:"h-auto max-w-full",src:r(a),alt:""},null,8,p)]),n(t)]))}};export{w as default};
